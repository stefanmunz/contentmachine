Big Tech let go of tens of thousands knowledge workers because they are no longer needed. That's at least the narrative we're being told for the last months. I think this is wrong and AI is used as a scapegoat for the manager's dream of the lean and efficient workforce they dreamt about for years already.

With robotics advancing, the next job fear-mongering wave is about to start.

Look, nobody can predict how knowledge or manual work will change with AI in the next decade. Most people have a good hunch that all our work will change, which is probably right, but it always was.

Looking back at history, there were a lot of huge technological advancements that changed and killed jobs. Cars killed jobs around horses. Digital media killed printing jobs.

But they also created a huge amount of jobs, and usually a diverse set: Cars created jobs from taxi driving to car assembly, repair shops, and engineers designing new cars.

Digital media created many jobs in designing, selling, advertising, and distributing media.

That is because one thing was always true and will stay true: Making things easier creates more demand!

If AI makes coding easier,we'll see more codebases in the future. Even though these code bases maybe will not be so much better than before.

Keep on building!
