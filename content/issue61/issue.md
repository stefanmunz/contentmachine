![A Personal Note: And No, It’s Not The End!](./banner.jpeg)

It's the week before Christmas. You're probably feeling the pressure to live up to all the expectations that Christmas brings each year. I hope you can let a few of them slide and choose to have a good time for a few hours in between.

From the outset, I have treated this newsletter as an experimental playground. I started out with lots of motivation for 3D printing, and I am still convinced it's a hugely powerful technology that will be adopted much more widely in the coming years. Then, even more interesting things happened: I switched my focus to agentic coding. In recent weeks, I've also incorporated a lot of content on local LLMs and the necessary software and hardware for this. This is because I'm trying to build a business in this area with [OnTree](https://ontree.co/).

Thank you for following me on this journey so far!

I realized that I write my best posts when I write about topics that interest me. I will continue to write this newsletter, but I won't be bound to any particular topics in the future. It might be about something that has just happened or something that I am currently working on. If you joined me for the AI content, I invite you to stick around over the next few weeks to see if you can still find value in the content. Since AI is keeping me busy, I expect there will still be plenty of AI-related content. If there's a topic you'd like to read about, just hit reply and let me know!

For the past few months, I have also been publishing the newsletter posts on my personal blog, [stefanmunz.com](https://www.stefanmunz.com/). If you prefer this method, feel free to dust off your old RSS reader and subscribe to my RSS feed!

Have a great Christmas with your loved ones!

Cheers, Stefan
