I've been all-in on Claude Code for a few months now, but couldn't pinpoint why it feels better than the benchmarks suggest. A new interview with its creator revealed the secret: they're prioritizing 'vibes' over metrics. It reminds me of the golden age of app development.

In this [newly released video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF9iV4xponk) with Boris Czerny, creator of Claude Code, there's an interesting segment about their work developing Claude Code. They struggle to objectively evaluate performance from both the models and Claude Code. He compares the models to horses and Claude Code to a saddle, emphasizing the need for a good match to perform. They try to quantify performance with evals, like everyone does, but it's harder than expected. Claude Code relies on the developers' gut feeling. The engineers listen closely to users and their problems. The feedback channel for Claude Code is one of the most active in the company. The developers have a mental map of the model's strengths and weaknesses. Depending on that, they tune Claude Code to fit the model. Like a saddle on a horse, not that I or Boris know anything about horse riding.

Even though there are a lot of benchmarks out there, they are not very meaningful. Most model makers adapt their next iteration to score high points in the benchmarks, which doesn't necessarily correlate with actual results.

As an ex-iOS engineer, this reminds me of the early iOS days. There were few standards for iOS app design and development. Most UI innovation came from small one or two-person apps with close connections to their users. They listened carefully and sought solutions. Pull to refresh was developed this way, for example. Only later it was adopted by Apple and Android.

When building new things, human vibing and gut feeling trump hard measurement. That doesn't mean measurement is pointless. Later, the measurement catches up and approaches become more quantifiable. For AI-enabled software development, trust your gut feeling more than your measurements.

I also learned about [custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) from the video. How cool is that? I'm gonna try it out in the next days for repetitive actions.

Have a great day!

- **MyTake:** Interesting deep dive on why MCP pollutes your context and is often not worth it. Matches my experience to prefer CLI tools over MCPs. Free subscription needed, unfortunately.

- **MyTake:** Ben Evans tries to put AI into perspective to historic innovations. I think he's wrong, but it's a good watch and arguments. Very clickbaity title though, not sure why it's needed.

- **MyTake:** No human could ever watch eels reproduce naturally. What a fun fact. Maybe this is AGI, when AI is able to watch eels reproduce naturally?

## What to Print This Week

### Complete Retail Display System

![Display System](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/eDK9YeMyLk65oQtXSTZztY/2QWhD5npFVfWFrieg8T436)

When you sell 3D-printed snakes at your local farmer's market, of course, it shows real dedication if your entire retail display system is 3D printed.

I like the approach of a tightening cable clip, so it adapts to your cable.

A mini GameBoy Keychain, complete with a swappable cartridge system for different images! I usually hate these glue-it-together approaches, still, I started printing this one.
