Distributed systems are inherently complex, but patterns like circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and bulkheads make them manageable. The key insight is accepting that failures are inevitable and designing for graceful degradation. Every network call can fail, every service can be temporarily unavailable, and every assumption about timing will eventually be wrong. Success comes from embracing these realities rather than fighting them.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

- **Title:** Martin Fowler on Circuit Breakers
- **URL:** https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html
- **MyTake:** The circuit breaker pattern is fundamental to building resilient microservices. It prevents cascading failures by failing fast when a service is struggling, giving it time to recover. This article brilliantly explains both the pattern and its implementation considerations.

### Distributed Tracing

- **Title:** Google's Dapper Paper
- **URL:** https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/
- **MyTake:** This seminal paper introduced distributed tracing at scale. Understanding how Google traces requests across thousands of services provides invaluable insights into debugging complex distributed systems. The concepts here directly influenced OpenTelemetry and modern observability tools.
